# Durian-Cash-Registration-System
## 📌 Project Overview
This is a console-based C++ application designed to help JKJT Durian Stall in Kampar manage its sales through a computerized cash registration system. It simulates menu and transaction handling using text files as the database, applying modular programming practices as part of the UCCD1004 Programming Concepts and Practices coursework.


## 🎯 Features
### 🗂 Menu Handling
- Add: Insert a new type of durian and its price range into durian.txt.
- Update: Modify the durian type or price range.
- Delete: Remove a durian type from the menu if it's no longer sold.

### 💸 Transaction Handling
- Add Transaction: Input customer purchases and log them into transaction.txt.
- Filter Transactions: View transaction history by date, durian type, or customer number.

### 🧾 File I/O
- Menu is stored in durian.txt
- Transactions are recorded in transaction.txt
- Both files follow a specific format defined in the assignment.


## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or above
- File Handling: Plain text files (.txt) for persistent storage
- Approach: Modular Programming, Functions, Basic Control Flow
